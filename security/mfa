All four are solid MFA tools that have been around for years and can handle a 
wide variety of situations, token types and applications; and all come in both cloud and 
on-premises versions, although there are some differences in labeling and packaging.

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): is an Extensible Markup Language 
(XML) standard that allows a user to log on once for affiliated but separate 
Web sites. SAML is designed for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer 
(B2C) transactions.


Security Token : 

 A security token is a physical device, such as a special smart card , 
 that together with something that a user knows, such as a PIN , will enable 
 authorized access to a computer system or network.
