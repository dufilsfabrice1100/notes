rsync -avr ~/Public/sample /tmp/junko

-a = archive
-v = verbose
-r = recursive

# dont create parent folder (trailing slash)
rsync -avr ~/Public/sample/ /tmp/junko

# delete files from destination folder that
# does not exist anymore in source folder
rsync -avr --delete ~/Public/sample/ /tmp/junko


-------------
# My MP3 sync sh/t for ipod/rockbox
# backup directory structure that has mp3s only, skips any other files

rsync -avrm --delete-excluded --include '*/' --include '*.mp3' --exclude '*' /SOURCE/ /DESTINATION

-m = delete empty folder


# For FAT32/NTFS filesystem with rsync
# basically this prevents rsync from copying again and again every fucking time on fat32/ntfs and maybe other filesystems other than linux
# since my ipod uses fat32; the timestamp is crap; so to fix this

rsync -avrm --delete-excluded --modify-window=2 --include '*/' --include '*.mp3' --exclude '*' /SOURCE/ /DESTINATION

--modify-window=NUM   -->  compare mod-times with reduced accuracy
